This example demonstrates an uncommon issue in Tcl where the error command terminates the script unexpectedly.  The `check_if_exists` procedure intends to check for the existence of a file and gracefully handle the case where the file doesn't exist. However, using error results in script termination, rather than just an error message.

The solution shows how to use try-catch to handle potential errors and allow the script to continue execution even if a file is not found.
